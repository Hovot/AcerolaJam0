Theme: Aberration

A departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically one that is unwelcome.

A literal intepretation of this theme involves the abnormal outcome of something measurable, 
such as chromatic aberration (a defective lens causing abnormal refraction), 
or perhaps an unexpected change in the flow of time, a temporal aberration. 
The abstract intepretations of this theme are endless of course and I don't think it's possible to take it too far. 
You could also capture the sinister undertones of this word's definition as a certain piece of media I like describes supernatural beings as aberrations (unwelcome entities you wouldn't expect to exist). 
This theme is all about defying expectations literally and abstractly, as well as getting really pretentious.
